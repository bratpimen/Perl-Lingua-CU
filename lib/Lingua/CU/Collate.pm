=head1 NAME

Lingua::CU::Collate - Collation for Church Slavonic in Unicode

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Lingua::CU::Collate;
 #construct
 $Collator = Lingua::CU::Collate->new(); # custom %tailoring may also be specified
 
 #sort
 @sorted = $Collator->sort(@not_sorted);
 
 #compare
 $result = $Collator->cmp($a, $b); # returns 1, 0, or -1.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lingua::CU::Collate is a wrapper around Unicode::Collate that provides a custom collation tailoring for Church Slavonic

All text supplied to this library must be encoded in UTF-8 and, unless otherwise specified, is assumed to be
in Unicode. For more on Church Slavonic using Unicode, and for a description of the tailoring, please see the paper
I<Roadmap for Church Slavonic Typography in the Unicode Standard> available at 
http://www.ponomar.net/.

This program is ALPHA STAGE SOFTWARE and is provided with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY of any kind,
express or implied, not even the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a purpose, or non-infringement.

=head2 EXPORT

This module provides no methods except for new. It only serves as a wrapper around Unicode::Collate.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Usage: C<new( %tailoring )>

Creates a new Unicode::Collate object. The same keys in C<tailoring> may be specified as would be specified in creating Unicode::Collate directly
however the following are reserved by Lingua::CU::Collate and may not be overwritten: C<suppress>, C<locale_version> 
and C<upper_before_lower>. If C<entry> is specified, it is appended to the entries specified by Lingua::CU::Collate.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This software is part of the Ponomar Project (see http://www.ponomar.net/â€‹).

Be sure to read the I<Roadmap for Church Slavonic Typography in the Unicode Standard> and to download the 
Unicode-compatible Hirmos Ponomar font.

Be sure to read as well C<perluniintro> and C<perllocale> in the Perl manual.
